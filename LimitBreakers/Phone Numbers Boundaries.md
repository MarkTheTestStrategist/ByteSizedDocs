# Phone Numbers - Boundaries

**TLDR;**
- Longest = 15
- Shortest = 7

The ITU standards limit a phone number to 15 digits. That’s the country code followed by the local phone number, and does not include any dialing prefixes (the 00 you dial in Europe for an international call, or the US equivalent, 011). There are several countries that actually have 15 digit numbers (Austria for example, with a two digit, 43, country code, allows phone numbers of 4–13 digits). Some of the satphone providers use pretty long numbers as well

The shortest “national significant number” at this time with no area codes is St Helena/Tristan de Cunha with a 7-digit IDD number and 4-digit dialing in the form of +290 2xxx for Jamestown, St Helena and +290 8xxx for Tristan de Cunha.

Tokelau uses single-digit area codes and 3-digit subscriber numbers without a “trunk prefix” (the leading “0” or “1”) so they also have a 7-digit IDD number. It is unclear if they use 3-digit dialing for calls within the same area code.

The longest numbers currently allowed under ITU-T E.164 is a 15-digit national significant number, but that includes up to 3 digits for a country code, leaving 12-to-14-digits for national numbering plans. Countries with shorter country codes can have longer domestic numbers. For example, the North American Dialling Plan area (country code +1) and Russia (country code +7) can have up to a 14-digit domestic number (both currently limited at 10 digits), and the UK (country code +44) can have up to 13 (also limited to 10 digits excluding the trunk prefix “0”). This difference in country code length was intentional initially because the maximum number of terminating stations was assumed based on country size, population and current telephone penetration in the late ‘50s, before the everyday use of fax machines, modems and the advent of mobile telephones. It was assumed that there would always be more telephones in the NANP and the Soviet Union than in places like China or India, which of course has turned out to be false!

The current longest telephone numbers in use are in Indonesia, at 12-digit numbers for pay-as-you-go mobile phones. China is at 11 for mobile phones and some large cities.
